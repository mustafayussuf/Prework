        <h2>Bio</h2>
        
        <p>Singer and actress Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, 
            New York. Raised in Detroit, Michigan. Determined to be a star, she signed a contract 
            with Jive Records at the age of 12 and came to popular acclaim in 1994. On her way home 
            from a music video shoot in 2001, a plane crash killed Aaliyah and eight members of her 
            film crew. She was 22 years old at the time of her death.
